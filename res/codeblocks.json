Unlike the existing state-of-the-art toolkits, such as Stanza, that adopt an independent model for each task, N-LTP adopts the multi-task framework by using a shared pre-trained model, which has the advantage of capturing the shared knowledge across relevant Chinese tasks. In addition, a knowledge distillation method (Clark et al., 2019) where the single-task model teaches the multi-task model is further introduced to encourage the multi-task model to surpass its single-task teacher. Finally, we provide a collection of easy-to-use APIs and a visualization tool to make users to use and view the processing results more easily and directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first toolkit to support six Chinese NLP fundamental tasks. Source code, documentation, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Sparse models not only improve computation and memory usage, but also enhance the generalization capacity, a principle that concurs with the law of parsimony. However, inappropriate sparsity modeling may also significantly degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose Approximation Vector Machine (AVM), a model that can simultaneously encourage the sparsity and safeguard its risk in compromising the performance. When an incoming instance arrives, we approximate this instance by one of its neighbors whose distance to it is less than a predefined threshold. Our key intuition is that since the newly seen instance is expressed by its nearby neighbor the optimal performance can be analytically formulated and maintained. We develop theoretical foundations to support this intuition and further establish an analysis to characterize the gap between the approximation and optimal solutions. This gap crucially depends on the frequency of approximation and the predefined threshold. We perform the convergence analysis for a wide spectrum of loss functions including Hinge, smooth Hinge, and Logistic for classification task, and l1, l2, and \u03f5-insensitive for regression task. We conducted extensive experiments for classification task in batch and online modes, and regression task in online mode over several benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed AVM achieved a comparable predictive performance with current state-of-the-art methods while simultaneously achieving significant computational speed-up due to the ability of the proposed AVM in maintaining the model size.},\n  keywords = {kernel, online learning, large-scale machine learning, sparsity, big data, core set, stochastic gradient descent, convergence analysis},\n  url      = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06518},\n  code      = {https://github.com/tund/avm},\n}\n</codeblock>"

We first present MTL results on five NLP tasks, POS, NER, DEP, CON, and SRL, and depict its deficiency over single-task learning. We then conduct an extensive pruning analysis to show that a certain set of attention heads get claimed by most tasks during MTL, who interfere with one another to fine-tune those heads for their own objectives. Based on this finding, we propose the Stem Cell Hypothesis to reveal the existence of attention heads naturally talented for many tasks that cannot be jointly trained to create adequate embeddings for all of those tasks. Finally, we design novel parameter-free probes to justify our hypothesis and demonstrate how attention heads are transformed across the five tasks during MTL through label analysis.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

It is common for a Chinese learner to comprehend the meaning of a\n\tword from these graphical components. As a result, we propose models that\n\tenhance word representations by character glyphs. The character glyph features\n\tare directly learned from the bitmaps of characters by convolutional\n\tauto-encoder(convAE), and the glyph features improve Chinese word\n\trepresentations which are already enhanced by character embeddings. Another\n\tcontribution in this paper is that we created several evaluation datasets in\n\ttraditional Chinese and made them public.},\n  url       = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1025}\n}\n</codeblock>"

With activity recognition having considerably matured so did the number of challenges in designing, implementing and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an activity recognition chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research and introduce the best practise methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognising different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.},\n    keywords = {}\n}\n</codeblock>"

Beam tracing algorithms have been used to calculate these paths efficiently, thus allowing modeling of acoustics in real-time with a moving listener in simple, or complex but densely occluded, environments with a stationary sound source. In this paper, it is shown that beam tracing algorithms can still be optimized by utilizing the spatial coherence in path validation with a moving listener. Since the precalculations required for the presented technique are relatively fast, the acoustic reflection paths can be calculated even for a moving source in simple cases. Simulations were performed to show how the accelerated algorithm compares with the basic algorithm with varying scene complexity and occlusion. Up to two-orders of magnitude speed-up was achieved.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, the optimisation of such complex models suffer from computational issues both in terms of convergence rates and memory requirements. Here, we present a forward-backward splitting (FBS) procedure for Gaussian graphical modelling of multivariate time-series which relies on recent theoretical studies ensuring convergence under mild assumptions. Our experiments show that a FBS-based implementation achieves, with very fast convergence rates, optimal results with respect to ground truth and standard methods for dynamical network inference. Optimisation algorithms which are usually exploited for network inference suffer from drawbacks when considering large sets of unknowns. Particularly for increasing data sets and model complexity, we argue for the use of fast and theoretically sound optimisation algorithms to be significant to the graphical modelling community.}\n}\n</codeblock>"

UniParse as a framework novelly streamlines research prototyping, development and evaluation of graph-based dependency parsing architectures. UniParse does this by enabling highly efficient, sufficiently independent, easily readable, and easily extensible implementations for all dependency parser components. We distribute the toolkit with ready-made configurations as re-implementations of all current state-of-the-art first-order graph-based parsers, including even more efficient Cython implementations of both encoders and decoders, as well as the required specialised loss functions.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Teasers are one of the main vehicles for transmitting news to social media users. We compile a novel dataset of teasers by systematically accumulating tweets and selecting those that conform to the teaser definition.

A teaser is a short reading suggestion for an article that is illustrative and includes curiosity-arousing elements to entice potential readers to read particular news items. Teasers are one of the main vehicles for transmitting news to social media users. We compile a novel dataset of teasers by systematically accumulating tweets and selecting those that conform to the teaser definition. We have compared a number of neural abstractive architectures on the task of teaser generation and the overall best performing system is See et al. seq2seq with pointer network.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We explore dense vector representations as an effective way to approximate the same information. We introduce a simple yet efficient and effective approach for learning graph embeddings. Instead of directly operating on the graph structure, our method takes structural measures of pairwise node similarities into account and learns dense node representations reflecting user-defined graph distance measures, such as e.g. the shortest path distance or distance measures that take information beyond the graph structure into account. We demonstrate a speed-up of several orders of magnitude when predicting word similarity by vector operations on our embeddings as opposed to directly computing the respective path-based measures, while outperforming various other graph embeddings on semantic similarity and word sense disambiguation tasks.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

The present end-to-end neural methods for dialog do not take this into account. They learn with the assumption that at any time there is only one correct next utterance. In this work, we focus on this problem in the goal-oriented dialog setting where there are different paths to reach a goal. We propose a new method, that uses a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning approaches to address this issue. We also propose a new and more effective testbed, permuted-bAbI dialog tasks, by introducing multiple valid next utterances to the original-bAbI dialog tasks, which allows evaluation of end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems in a more realistic setting. We show that there is a significant drop in performance of existing end-to-end neural methods from 81.5{\\%} per-dialog accuracy on original-bAbI dialog tasks to 30.3{\\%} on permuted-bAbI dialog tasks. We also show that our proposed method improves the performance and achieves 47.3{\\%} per-dialog accuracy on permuted-bAbI dialog tasks. We also release permuted-bAbI dialog tasks, our proposed testbed, to the community for evaluating dialog systems in a goal-oriented setting.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

As finding and annotating such potential duplicates manually is very tedious and costly, automatic methods based on machine learning are a viable alternative. However, many forums do not have annotated data, i.e., questions labeled by experts as duplicates, and thus a promising solution is to use domain adaptation from another forum that has such annotations. Here we focus on adversarial domain adaptation, deriving important findings about when it performs well and what properties of the domains are important in this regard. Our experiments with StackExchange data show an average improvement of 5.6{\\%} over the best baseline across multiple pairs of domains.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Due to the architectural similarity between stack RNNs and pushdown transducers, we train stack RNN models on a number of tasks, including string reversal, context-free language modelling, and cumulative XOR evaluation. Examining the behavior of our networks, we show that stack-augmented RNNs can discover intuitive stack-based strategies for solving our tasks. However, stack RNNs are more difficult to train than classical architectures such as LSTMs. Rather than employ stack-based strategies, more complex stack-augmented networks often find approximate solutions by using the stack as unstructured memory.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, annotators are often unreliable and current aggregation methods cannot capture common types of span annotation error. To address this, we propose a Bayesian method for aggregating sequence tags that reduces errors by modelling sequential dependencies between the annotations as well as the ground-truth labels. By taking a Bayesian approach, we account for uncertainty in the model due to both annotator errors and the lack of data for modelling annotators who complete few tasks. We evaluate our model on crowdsourced data for named entity recognition, information extraction and argument mining, showing that our sequential model outperforms the previous state of the art, and that Bayesian approaches outperform non-Bayesian alternatives. We also find that our approach can reduce crowdsourcing costs through more effective active learning, as it better captures uncertainty in the sequence labels when there are few annotations.\",\n}\n</codeblock>",

Typically, enforcing invertibility requires partitioning dimensions or restricting network architectures. In contrast, our approach only requires adding a simple normalization step during training, already available in standard frameworks. Invertible ResNets define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible ResNets perform competitively with both state-of-the-art image classifiers and flow-based generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single architecture.}\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, understanding the properties of the data is crucial in perfecting models. In this paper we analyse exactly which characteristics of a dataset best determine how difficult that dataset is for the task of text classification. We then propose an intuitive measure of difficulty for text classification datasets which is simple and fast to calculate. We empirically prove that this measure generalises to unseen data by comparing it to state-of-the-art datasets and results. This measure can be used to analyse the precise source of errors in a dataset and allows fast estimation of how difficult a dataset is to learn. We searched for this measure by training 12 classical and neural network based models on 78 real-world datasets, then use a genetic algorithm to discover the best measure of difficulty. Our difficulty-calculating code and datasets are publicly available.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We focus on the challenging real-world problem of action-graph extraction from materials science papers, where language is highly specialized and data annotation is expensive and scarce. We propose a novel approach, Text2Quest, where procedural text is interpreted as instructions for an interactive game. A learning agent completes the game by executing the procedure correctly in a text-based simulated lab environment. The framework can complement existing approaches and enables richer forms of learning compared to static texts. We discuss potential limitations and advantages of the approach, and release a prototype proof-of-concept, hoping to encourage research in this direction.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Lately, there has been considerable interest in GP's community to develop semantic genetic operators, i.e., operators that work on the phenotype. In this contribution, we describe EvoDAG (Evolving Directed Acyclic Graph) which is a Python library that implements a steady-state semantic Genetic Programming with tournament selection using an extension of our previous crossover operators based on orthogonal projections in the phenotype space. To show the effectiveness of EvoDAG, it is compared against state-of-the-art classifiers on different benchmark problems, experimental results indicate that EvoDAG is very competitive.},\n\tbooktitle = {2016 {IEEE} {International} {Autumn} {Meeting} on {Power}, {Electronics} and {Computing} ({ROPEC})},\n\tauthor = {Graff, M. and Tellez, E.

Current works have attempted to recognize AUs by emphasizing important regions. However, the incorporation of expert prior knowledge into region definition remains under-exploited, and current AU detection approaches do not use regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) with expert prior knowledge to directly focus on AU-related regions adaptively. By incorporating expert prior knowledge, we propose a novel R-CNN based model named AU R-CNN. The proposed solution offers two main contributions: (1) AU R-CNN directly observes different facial regions, where various AUs are located. Expert prior knowledge is encoded in the region and the RoI-level label definition. This design produces considerably better detection performance than existing approaches. (2) We integrate various dynamic models (including convolutional long short-term memory, two stream network, conditional random field, and temporal action localization network) into AU R-CNN and then investigate and analyze the reason behind the performance of dynamic models. Experiment results demonstrate that only static RGB image information and no optical flow-based AU R-CNN surpasses the one fused with dynamic models. AU R-CNN is also superior to traditional CNNs that use the same backbone on varying image resolutions. State-of-the-art recognition performance of AU detection is achieved. The complete network is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made available.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, their left-to-right generation procedure only allows a limited control from a potential user which makes them unsuitable for interactive and creative usages such as interactive music generation. This article introduces a novel architecture called anticipation-RNN which possesses the assets of the RNN-based generative models while allowing to enforce user-defined unary constraints. We demonstrate its efficiency on the task of generating melodies satisfying unary constraints in the style of the soprano parts of the J.S. Bach chorale harmonizations. Sampling using the anticipation-RNN is of the same order of complexity than sampling from the traditional RNN model. This fast and interactive generation of musical sequences opens ways to devise real-time systems that could be used for creative purposes.\",\nissn=\"1433-3058\",\ndoi=\"10.1007/s00521-018-3868-4\",\nurl=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-018-3868-4\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

Leveraging recent advances in variational inference with implicit distributions, we put forth a statistical inference framework that enables the end-to-end training of surrogate models on paired input--output observations that may be stochastic in nature, originate from different information sources of variable fidelity, or be corrupted by complex noise processes. The resulting surrogates can accommodate high-dimensional inputs and outputs and are able to return predictions with quantified uncertainty. The effectiveness our approach is demonstrated through a series of canonical studies, including the regression of noisy data, multi-fidelity modeling of stochastic processes, and uncertainty propagation in high-dimensional dynamical systems.\",\nissn=\"1432-0924\",\ndoi=\"10.1007/s00466-019-01718-y\",\nurl=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00466-019-01718-y\"\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

We propose to train personalized models that leverage a collaboration graph describing the relationships between user personal tasks, which we learn jointly with the models. Our fully decentralized optimization procedure alternates between training nonlinear models given the graph in a greedy boosting manner, and updating the collaboration graph (with controlled sparsity) given the models. Throughout the process, users exchange messages only with a small number of peers (their direct neighbors when updating the models, and a few random users when updating the graph), ensuring that the procedure naturally scales with the number of users. Overall, our approach is communication-efficient and avoids exchanging personal data. We provide an extensive analysis of the convergence rate, memory and communication complexity of our approach, and demonstrate its benefits compared to competing techniques on synthetic and real datasets.} \n} \n</codeblock>"

Pertinent methods are severely inhibited by the high-dimension of the parametric input and the limited number of training input/output pairs that can be generated when computationally demanding forward models are considered. Such cases are frequently encountered in the modeling of random heterogeneous media where the scale of the microstructure necessitates the use of high-dimensional random vectors and very fine discretizations of the governing equations. The present paper proposes a probabilistic Machine Learning framework that is capable of operating in the presence of Small Data by exploiting aspects of the physical structure of the problem as well as contextual knowledge. As a result, it can perform comparably well under extrapolative conditions. It unifies the tasks of dimensionality and model-order reduction through an encoder-decoder scheme that simultaneously identifies a sparse set of salient lower-dimensional microstructural features and calibrates an inexpensive, coarse-grained model which is predictive of the output. Information loss is accounted for and quantified in the form of probabilistic predictive estimates. The learning engine is based on Stochastic Variational Inference. We demonstrate how the variational objectives can be used not only to train the coarse-grained model, but also to suggest refinements that lead to improved predictions.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

We specifically target discontinuity, an under-explored aspect that poses a significant challenge to computational treatment of MWEs. Two neural architectures are explored: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and multi-head self-attention. GCN leverages dependency parse information, and self-attention attends to long-range relations. We finally propose a combined model that integrates complementary information from both, through a gating mechanism. The experiments on a standard multilingual dataset for verbal MWEs show that our model outperforms the baselines not only in the case of discontinuous MWEs but also in overall F-score.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

In this work, we propose a visually realistic, flexible and robust grasping system that enables real-time interactions in virtual environments. Resulting grasps are visually realistic because hand is automatically fitted to the object shape from a position and orientation determined by the user using the VR handheld controllers (e.g. Oculus Touch motion controllers). Our approach is flexible because it can be adapted to different hand meshes (e.g. human or robotic hands) and it is also easily customizable. Moreover, it enables interaction with different objects regardless their geometries. In order to validate our proposal, an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative performance analysis has been carried out. On one hand, qualitative evaluation was used in the assessment of abstract aspects, such as motor control, finger movement realism, and interaction realism. On the other hand, for the quantitative evaluation a novel metric has been proposed to visually analyze the performed grips. Performance analysis results indicate that previous experience with our grasping system is not a prerequisite for an enjoyable, natural and intuitive VR interaction experience.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

Current solutions assume that the lexicon which defines the alignment pairs is noise-free. We consider the case where the set of aligned points is allowed to contain an amount of noise, in the form of incorrect lexicon pairs and show that this arises in practice by analyzing the edited dictionaries after the cleaning process. We demonstrate that such noise substantially degrades the accuracy of the learned translation when using current methods. We propose a model that accounts for noisy pairs. This is achieved by introducing a generative model with a compatible iterative EM algorithm. The algorithm jointly learns the noise level in the lexicon, finds the set of noisy pairs, and learns the mapping between the spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on two alignment problems: bilingual word embedding translation, and mapping between diachronic embedding spaces for recovering the semantic shifts of words across time periods.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets.

Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},\n  keywords      = {programming languages, formal verification, certified compilation, quantum computing, circuit optimization},\n  note          = {POPL '21}\n}\n</codeblock>",

This is because IRL typically seeks a reward function that makes the demonstrator appear near-optimal, rather than inferring the underlying intentions of the demonstrator that may have been poorly executed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation algorithm, Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX), that extrapolates beyond a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations. When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration. We also demonstrate that T-REX is robust to ranking noise and can accurately extrapolate intention by simply watching a learner noisily improve at a task over time.}\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, they still lack generalization capabilities in conditions that differ from the ones encountered during training. This is even more challenging in specialized, and knowledge intensive domains, where training data is limited. To address this gap, we introduce {MedNLI} - a dataset annotated by doctors, performing a natural language inference task ({NLI}), grounded in the medical history of patients. We present strategies to: 1) leverage transfer learning using datasets from the open domain, (e.g. {SNLI}) and 2) incorporate domain knowledge from external data and lexical sources (e.g. medical terminologies). Our results demonstrate performance gains using both strategies.},\n\tjournaltitle = {{arXiv}:1808.06752 [cs]},\n\tauthor = {Romanov, Alexey and Shivade, Chaitanya},\n\turldate = {2018-08-27},\n\tdate = {2018-08-21},\n\teprinttype = {arxiv},\n\teprint = {1808.06752},\n}\n</codeblock>"

The format is simple enough that users of AMR data often write small scripts or libraries for parsing it into an internal graph representation, but there is enough complexity that these users could benefit from a more sophisticated and well-tested solution. The open-source Python library Penman provides a robust parser, functions for graph inspection and manipulation, and functions for formatting graphs into PENMAN notation. Many functions are also available in a command-line tool, thus extending its utility to non-Python setups.\",\n}\n</codeblock>",

We then develop an inference approach that allows us to synthesize a more expressive global network without additional supervision, data pooling and with as few as a single communication round.

It remains a fundamental question on how to evaluate whether a system has the sense-making capability. Existing benchmarks measure common sense knowledge indirectly or without reasoning. In this paper, we release a benchmark to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense. In addition, a system is asked to identify the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense. We evaluate models trained over large-scale language modeling tasks as well as human performance, showing that there are different challenges for system sense-making.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

The model presented here draws upon the strengths of state-of-the-art language and coreference resolution models, and introduces a novel evidence-based deep learning architecture. Injecting evidence from the coreference models compliments the base architecture, and analysis shows that the model is not hindered by their weaknesses, specifically gender bias. The modularity and simplicity of the architecture make it very easy to extend for further improvement and applicable to other NLP problems. Evaluation on GAP test data results in a state-of-the-art performance at 92.5{\\%} F1 (gender bias of 0.97), edging closer to the human performance of 96.6{\\%}. The end-to-end solution presented here placed 1st in the Kaggle competition, winning by a significant lead.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

It has, however, proven difficult to assess the degree to which such a bias is effective, as the operation of the differentiable stack is not always interpretable. In this paper, we attempt to detect the presence of latent representations of hierarchical structure through an exploration of the unsupervised learning of constituency structure. Using a technique due to Shen et al. (2018a,b), we extract syntactic trees from the pushing behavior of stack RNNs trained on language modeling and classification objectives. We find that our models produce parses that reflect natural language syntactic constituencies, demonstrating that stack RNNs do indeed infer linguistically relevant hierarchical structure.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

To facilitate automatic language understanding, we study keyphrase prediction, distilling salient information from massive posts. While most existing methods extract words from source posts to form keyphrases, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based neural keyphrase generation framework, enabling absent keyphrases to be created. Moreover, our model, being topic-aware, allows joint modeling of corpus-level latent topic representations, which helps alleviate data sparsity widely exhibited in social media language. Experiments on three datasets collected from English and Chinese social media platforms show that our model significantly outperforms both extraction and generation models without exploiting latent topics. Further discussions show that our model learns meaningful topics, which interprets its superiority in social media keyphrase generation.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

This constrains the answer of any question to be a span of text in Wikipedia. Open domain QA for Arabic entails three challenges: annotated QA datasets in Arabic, large scale efficient information retrieval and machine reading comprehension. To deal with the lack of Arabic QA datasets we present the Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD) composed of 1,395 questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, and a machine translation of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Arabic-SQuAD). Our system for open domain question answering in Arabic (SOQAL) is based on two components: (1) a document retriever using a hierarchical TF-IDF approach and (2) a neural reading comprehension model using the pre-trained bi-directional transformer BERT. Our experiments on ARCD indicate the effectiveness of our approach with our BERT-based reader achieving a 61.3 F1 score, and our open domain system SOQAL achieving a 27.6 F1 score.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We achieve new state-of-the-art results using carefully chosen training data for language models. For a low-resource domain like named entity recognition for Historic German, language model pre-training can be a strong competitor to CRF-only methods. We show that language model pre-training can be more effective than using transfer-learning with labeled datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a new language model pre-training objective, synthetic masked language model pre-training (SMLM), that allows a transfer from one domain (contemporary texts) to another domain (historical texts) by using only the same (character) vocabulary. Results show that using SMLM can achieve comparable results for Historic named entity recognition, even when they are only trained on contemporary texts. Our pre-trained character-based language models improve upon classical CRF-based methods and previous work on Bi-LSTMs by boosting F1 score performance by up to 6{\\%}.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

While over half of patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at a distant stage, patients who are diagnosed early enjoy a much higher 5-year survival rate of 34{\\%} compared to 3{\\%} in the former; hence, early diagnosis is key. Unique challenges in the medical imaging domain such as extremely limited annotated data sets and typically large 3D volumetric data have made it difficult for deep learning to secure a strong foothold. In this work, we construct two novel ``inflated'' deep network architectures, InceptINN and DenseINN, for the task of diagnosing IPMN from multisequence (T1 and T2) MRI. These networks inflate their 2D layers to 3D and bootstrap weights from their 2D counterparts (Inceptionv3 and DenseNet121 respectively) trained on ImageNet to the new 3D kernels. We also extend the inflation process by further expanding the pre-trained kernels to handle any number of input modalities and different fusion strategies. This is one of the first studies to train an end-to-end deep network on multisequence MRI for IPMN diagnosis, and shows that our proposed novel inflated network architectures are able to handle the extremely limited training data (139 MRI scans), while providing an absolute improvement of {\\$}{\\$}{\\backslash}varvec{\\{}8.76{\\}}{\\$}{\\$}{\\%} in accuracy for diagnosing IPMN over the current state-of-the-art.

Automated methods applied to large textual corpora can be seen as opportunities for novel statistical studies of language development over time, as well as for improving cross-lingual natural language processing techniques. In this work, we first propose how to represent textual data as a directed, weighted network by the text2net algorithm. We next explore how various fast, network-topological metrics, such as network community structure, can be used for cross-lingual comparisons. In our experiments, we employ eight different network topology metrics, and empirically showcase on a parallel corpus, how the methods can be used for modeling the relations between nine selected languages. We demonstrate that the proposed method scales to large corpora consisting of hundreds of thousands of aligned sentences on an of-the-shelf laptop. We observe that on the one hand properties such as communities, capture some of the known differences between the languages, while others can be seen as novel opportunities for linguistic studies.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-31372-2\"\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

It is an extractive text summarization method which leverages the semantic information in existing sentence embedding spaces. Our method creates an extractive summary by selecting the sentences with the closest embeddings to the document embedding. The model earns a transformation of the document embedding to minimize the similarity between the extractive summary and the ground truth summary. As the transformation is only composed of a dense layer, the training can be done on CPU, therefore, inexpensive. Moreover, inference time is short and linear according to the number of sentences. As a second contribution, we introduce the French CASS dataset, composed of judgments from the French Court of cassation and their corresponding summaries. On this dataset, our results show that our method performs similarly to the state of the art extractive methods with effective training and inferring time.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, their inability to handle new user behavior at deployment has limited their usage in real world. In this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable method for neural goal-oriented dialog systems that handles new user behaviors at deployment by transferring the dialog to a human agent intelligently. The proposed method has three goals: 1) maximize user's task success by transferring to human agents, 2) minimize the load on the human agents by transferring to them only when it is essential, and 3) learn online from the human agent's responses to reduce human agents' load further. We evaluate our proposed method on a modified-bAbI dialog task, which simulates the scenario of new user behaviors occurring at test time. Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective in achieving the desired goals.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Network communities correspond to densely connected subnetworks, and often represent key functional parts of real-world systems. This paper proposes the embedding-based Silhouette community detection (SCD), an approach for detecting communities, based on clustering of network node embeddings, i.e. real valued representations of nodes derived from their neighborhoods. We investigate the performance of the proposed SCD approach on 234 synthetic networks, as well as on a real-life social network. Even though SCD is not based on any form of modularity optimization, it performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art community detection algorithms, such as the InfoMap and Louvain. Further, we demonstrate that SCD's outputs can be used along with domain ontologies in semantic subgroup discovery, yielding human-understandable explanations of communities detected in a real-life protein interaction network. Being embedding-based, SCD is widely applicable and can be tested out-of-the-box as part of many existing network learning and exploration pipelines.},\nissn={1573-0565},\ndoi={10.1007/s10994-020-05882-8},\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-020-05882-8}\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

First, accounts are identified by long and incompressible constants. Second, these \n        constants have to be stored and communicated for each payment. Third, the standard interface for token transfers does not support lists of recipients, adding repeated communication to the overhead. Since Ethereum charges resource usage, even small optimizations translate to cost savings. Airdrops, a \n        popular marketing tool used to boost coin uptake, present a relevant example for the value of optimizing bulk transfers. Therefore, we review technical solutions for airdrops of Ethereum-based tokens, discuss features and prerequisites, and compare the operational costs by simulating 35 scenarios. We \n        find that cost savings of factor two are possible, but require specific provisions in the smart contract implementing the token system. Pull-based approaches, which use on-chain interaction with the recipients, promise moderate savings for the distributor while imposing a disproportional cost on each \n        recipient. Total costs are broadly linear in the number of recipients independent of the technical approach. We publish the code of the simulation framework for reproducibility, to support future airdrop decisions, and to benchmark innovative bulk payment solutions.},\n\turldate = {2019-07-30},\n\tjournal = {arXiv:1907.12383 [cs]},\n\tauthor = {Fr\u00f6wis, Michael and B\u00f6hme, Rainer},\n\tmonth = jul,\n\tyear = {2019},\n\tnote = {arXiv: 1907.12383},\n\tkeywords = {Computer Science - Cryptography and Security, Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Science - Software Engineering}\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, for languages with complex and ambiguous word-internal structure, known as morphologically rich languages (MRLs), it has been hypothesized that syntactic context may be crucial for accurate MA{\\&amp;}D, and vice versa. In this work we empirically confirm this hypothesis for Modern Hebrew, an MRL with complex morphology and severe word-level ambiguity, in a novel transition-based framework. Specifically, we propose a joint morphosyntactic transition-based framework which formally unifies two distinct transition systems, morphological and syntactic, into a single transition-based system with joint training and joint inference. We empirically show that MA{\\&amp;}D results obtained in the joint settings outperform MA{\\&amp;}D results obtained by the respective standalone components, and that end-to-end parsing results obtained by our joint system present a new state of the art for Hebrew dependency parsing.\", \n}\n</codeblock>",

One such method is expectation regularization (XR) (Mann and McCallum, 2007), where models are trained based on expected label proportions. We propose a novel application of the XR framework for transfer learning between related tasks, where knowing the labels of task A provides an estimation of the label proportion of task B. We then use a model trained for A to label a large corpus, and use this corpus with an XR loss to train a model for task B. To make the XR framework applicable to large-scale deep-learning setups, we propose a stochastic batched approximation procedure. We demonstrate the approach on the task of Aspect-based Sentiment classification, where we effectively use a sentence-level sentiment predictor to train accurate aspect-based predictor. The method improves upon fully supervised neural system trained on aspect-level data, and is also cumulative with LM-based pretraining, as we demonstrate by improving a BERT-based Aspect-based Sentiment model.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

In this study, we address this in two ways. First, we propose task setups in which we specifically test a REG system{'}s ability to generalize to entities not seen during training. Second, we propose a profile-based deep neural network model, ProfileREG, which encodes both the local context and an external profile of the entity to generate reference realizations. Our model generates tokens by learning to choose between generating pronouns, generating from a fixed vocabulary, or copying a word from the profile. We evaluate our model on three different splits of the WebNLG dataset, and show that it outperforms competitive baselines in all settings according to automatic and human evaluations.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

While initially inspired by brain anatomy, over the past years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance, yet bringing into question how brain-like they still are. In particular, typical deep models from the machine learning community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as recurrence. Here we demonstrate that better anatomical alignment to the brain and high performance on machine learning as well as neuroscience measures do not have to be in contradiction. We developed CORnet-S, a shallow ANN with four anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, guided by Brain-Score, a new large-scale composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. Despite being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Moreover, our extensive analyses of CORnet-S circuitry variants reveal that recurrence is the main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the CORnet-S \"IT\" neural population resembles the actual monkey IT population dynamics. Taken together, these results establish CORnet-S, a compact, recurrent ANN, as the current best model of the primate ventral visual stream.},\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\narxivId = {1909.06161},\nauthor = {Kubilius, Jonas and Schrimpf, Martin and Hong, Ha and Majaj, Najib J. and Rajalingham, Rishi and Issa, Elias B. and Kar, Kohitij and Bashivan, Pouya and Prescott-Roy, Jonathan and Schmidt, Kailyn and Nayebi, Aran and Bear, Daniel and Yamins, Daniel L.

Since most dependencies are short-distance, common evaluation metrics will be little influenced by how well systems perform on them. We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT. The extracted sets are large enough to allow reliable automatic evaluation, which makes the proposed approach a scalable and practical solution for evaluating MT performance on the long-tail of syntactic phenomena.\",\n}```\n</codeblock>"

While it has been demonstrated that human judgments can suffer from the inconsistency of ratings, extant research has also found that the design of the evaluation task affects the consistency and quality of human judgments. We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively impact consistency and agreement amongst raters.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We show that using pre-trained image classification models along with usage of data augmentation techniques results in higher performance over alternative approaches. We applied this system to the task of Urban Sound Tagging, part of the DCASE 2019. The objective was to label different sources of noise from raw audio data. A modified form of MobileNetV2, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained to classify both coarse and fine tags jointly. The proposed model uses log-scaled Mel-spectrogram as the representation format for the audio data. Mixup, Random erasing, scaling, and shifting are used as data augmentation techniques. A second model that uses scaled labels was built to account for human errors in the annotations. The proposed model achieved the first rank on the leaderboard with Micro-AUPRC values of 0.751 and 0.860 on fine and coarse tags, respectively.\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

While the explicit constraint naturally avoids posterior collapse, we use it to further understand the significance of the KL term in controlling the information transmitted through the VAE channel.

With increasing amounts of data that lead to large multilayer networks consisting of different node and edge types, that can also be subject to temporal change, there is an increasing need for versatile visualization and analysis software. This work presents a lightweight Python library, Py3plex, which focuses on the visualization and analysis of multilayer networks. The library implements a set of simple graphical primitives supporting intra- as well as inter-layer visualization. It also supports many common operations on multilayer networks, such as aggregation, slicing, indexing, traversal, and more. The paper also focuses on how node embeddings can be used to speed up contemporary (multilayer) layout computation.

The key idea of SneakySnake is to reduce the approximate string matching (ASM) problem to the single net routing (SNR) problem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in finding the optimal path that connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a special grid layout that contains obstacles. The SneakySnake algorithm quickly solves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal path to decide whether or not performing sequence alignment is necessary. Reducing the ASM problem into SNR also makes SneakySnake efficient to implement on CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs.SneakySnake significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art pre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper and SHD. For short sequences, SneakySnake accelerates Edlib (state-of-the-art implementation of Myers\u2019s bit-vector algorithm) and Parasail (state-of-the-art sequence aligner with a configurable scoring function), by up to 37.7\u00d7 and 43.9\u00d7 (\\\\&amp;gt;12\u00d7 on average), respectively, with its CPU implementation, and by up to 413\u00d7 and 689\u00d7 (\\\\&amp;gt;400\u00d7 on average), respectively, with FPGA and GPU acceleration. For long sequences, the CPU implementation of SneakySnake accelerates Parasail and KSW2 (sequence aligner of minimap2) by up to 979\u00d7 (276.9\u00d7 on average) and 91.7\u00d7 (31.7\u00d7 on average), respectively. As SneakySnake does not replace sequence alignment, users can still obtain all capabilities (e.g. configurable scoring functions) of the aligner of their choice, unlike existing acceleration efforts that sacrifice some aligner capabilities.https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SneakySnake.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}\",\n    issn = {1367-4803},\n    doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1015},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1015},\n    note = {btaa1015},\n    eprint = {https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1015/35152174/btaa1015.pdf},\n}\n</codeblock>"

Of the few limited works which differentiate between trusted vs other types of news article (satire, propaganda, hoax), none of them model sentence interactions within a document. We observe an interesting pattern in the way sentences interact with each other across different kind of news articles. To capture this kind of information for long news articles, we propose a graph neural network-based model which does away with the need of feature engineering for fine grained fake news classification. Through experiments, we show that our proposed method beats strong neural baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on existing datasets. Moreover, we establish the generalizability of our model by evaluating its performance in out-of-domain scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to deal with predictions of volume, speed and main traffic direction, in a new aggregated way of traffic data presented as videos. Our approach leverages the continuity in a sequence of frames, learning to embed them into a low dimensional space with an encoder and making predictions there using recurrent layers, ensuring good performance through an embedded loss, and then, recovering back spatial dimensions with a decoder using a second loss at a pixel level. Exogenous variables like weather, time and calendar are also added in the model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling approach for sequences that ensures diversity when creating batches, running in parallel to the optimization process.} }\n</codeblock>"

It offers insights into behaviour of complex, real-world systems which cannot be modeled directly using propositional learning. We propose Symbolic Graph Embedding (SGE), an algorithm aimed to learn symbolic node representations. Built on the ideas from the field of inductive logic programming, SGE first samples a given node's neighborhood and interprets it as a transaction database, which is used for frequent pattern mining to identify logical conjuncts of items that co-occur frequently in a given context. Such patterns are in this work used as features to represent individual nodes, yielding interpretable, symbolic node embeddings. The proposed SGE approach on a venue classification task outperforms shallow node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, and performs similarly to metapath2vec, a black-box representation learner that can exploit node and edge types in a given graph. The proposed SGE approach performs especially well when small amounts of data are used for learning, scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges, and can be run on an of-the-shelf laptop.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-33778-0\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model. In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently, they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach, Active$\\mathbf{^2}$ Learning (A$\\mathbf{^2}$L), actively adapts to the deep learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A$\\mathbf{^2}$L is widely applicable by using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by $\\approx \\mathbf{3-25\\%}$ on an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance with virtually no additional computation overhead.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We present PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750 questions about the privacy policies of mobile applications, and over 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. We observe that a strong neural baseline underperforms human performance by almost 0.3 F1 on PrivacyQA, suggesting considerable room for improvement for future systems. Further, we use this dataset to categorically identify challenges to question answerability, with domain-general implications for any question answering system. The PrivacyQA corpus offers a challenging corpus for question answering, with genuine real world utility.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

As far as we know, LIDA is the first dialogue annotation system that handles the entire dialogue annotation pipeline from raw text, as may be the output of transcription services, to structured conversation data. Furthermore it supports the integration of arbitrary machine learning mod-els as annotation recommenders and also has a dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements such as after crowdsourcing an-notations for a dataset.

While recent work has achieved considerable performance gains by using neural networks, how to model the copying mechanism for APE remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new method for modeling copying for APE. To better identify translation errors, our method learns the representations of source sentences and system outputs in an interactive way. These representations are used to explicitly indicate which words in the system outputs should be copied. Finally, CopyNet (Gu et al., 2016) can be combined with our method to place the copied words in correct positions in post-edited translations. Experiments on the datasets of the WMT 2016-2017 APE shared tasks show that our approach outperforms all best published results.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Variants of GCN are used in multiple state-of-the-art approaches and therefore it is important to understand the specifics and limitations of GCN-based models. Despite serious efforts, we were not able to fully reproduce the results from the original paper and after a thorough audit of the code provided by authors, we concluded, that their implementation is different from the architecture described in the paper. In addition, several tricks are required to make the model work and some of them are not very intuitive.We provide an extensive ablation study to quantify the effects these tricks and changes of architecture have on final performance. Furthermore, we examine current evaluation approaches and systematize available benchmark datasets.We believe that people interested in KG matching might profit from our work, as well as novices entering the field.

BLiMP consists of 67 individual datasets, each containing 1,000 minimal pairs\u2014that is, pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability and isolate specific phenomenon in syntax, morphology, or semantics. We generate the data according to linguist-crafted grammar templates, and human aggregate agreement with the labels is 96.4\\%. We evaluate n-gram, LSTM, and Transformer (GPT-2 and Transformer-XL) LMs by observing whether they assign a higher probability to the acceptable sentence in each minimal pair. We find that state-of-the-art models identify morphological contrasts related to agreement reliably, but they struggle with some subtle semantic and syntactic phenomena, such as negative polarity items and extraction islands. }\n}\n</codeblock>"

However such methods usually require large amounts of annotated data to be effective. Since most standard ad-hoc information retrieval datasets publicly available for academic research (e.g. Robust04, ClueWeb09) have at most 250 annotated queries, the recent deep learning models for information retrieval perform poorly on these datasets. These models (e.g. DUET, Conv-KNRM) are trained and evaluated on data collected from commercial search engines not publicly available for academic research which is a problem for reproducibility and the advancement of research. In this paper, we propose WIKIR: an open-source toolkit to automatically build large-scale English information retrieval datasets based on Wikipedia. WIKIR is publicly available on GitHub. We also provide wikIR59k: a large-scale publicly available dataset that contains 59,252 queries and 2,617,003 (query, relevant documents) pairs.\",\nlanguage = \"English\",\nISBN = \"979-10-95546-34-4\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Global node encoding allows explicit communication between two distant nodes, thereby neglecting graph topology as all nodes are directly connected. In contrast, local node encoding considers the relations between neighbor nodes capturing the graph structure, but it can fail to capture long-range relations. In this work, we gather both encoding strategies, proposing novel neural models that encode an input graph combining both global and local node contexts, in order to learn better contextualized node embeddings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approaches lead to significant improvements on two graph-to-text datasets achieving BLEU scores of 18.01 on the AGENDA dataset, and 63.69 on the WebNLG dataset for seen categories, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 3.7 and 3.1 points, respectively. }\n}\n</codeblock>"

We introduce CoVoST, a multilingual speech-to-text translation corpus from 11 languages into English, diversified with over 11,000 speakers and over 60 accents. We describe the dataset creation methodology and provide empirical evidence of the quality of the data. We also provide initial benchmarks, including, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end many-to-one multilingual models for spoken language translation. CoVoST is released under CC0 license and free to use.

Several benchmarks have been proposed that assess the performance of triple stores. However, no integrated benchmark-independent execution framework for these benchmarks has yet been provided. We propose a novel SPARQL benchmark execution framework called Iguana. Our framework complements benchmarks by providing an execution environment which can measure the performance of triple stores during data loading, data updates as well as under different loads and parallel requests. Moreover, it allows a uniform comparison of results on different benchmarks. We execute the FEASIBLE and DBPSB benchmarks using the Iguana framework and measure the performance of popular triple stores under updates and parallel user requests. We compare our results (See https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3767501.v1) with state-of-the-art benchmarking results and show that our benchmark execution framework can unveil new insights pertaining to the performance of triple stores.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-319-68204-4\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

Since the acquisition of reference summaries is costly, existing datasets contain only hundreds of samples at most, resulting in heavy reliance on hand-crafted features or necessitating additional, manually annotated data. The lack of large corpora therefore hinders the development of sophisticated models. Additionally, most publicly available multi-document summarization corpora are in the news domain, and no analogous dataset exists in the video game domain. In this paper, we propose GameWikiSum, a new domain-specific dataset for multi-document summarization, which is one hundred times larger than commonly used datasets, and in another domain than news. Input documents consist of long professional video game reviews as well as references of their gameplay sections in Wikipedia pages. We analyze the proposed dataset and show that both abstractive and extractive models can be trained on it.

State-of-the-art deep learning-based models require a large number of data to achieve their best performance. Many datasets fulfilling this criterion have been proposed for multiple domains, such as Amazon products, restaurants, or beers. However, works and datasets in the hotel domain are limited: the largest hotel review dataset is below the million samples. Additionally, the hotel domain suffers from a higher data sparsity than traditional recommendation datasets and therefore, traditional collaborative-filtering approaches cannot be applied to such data. In this paper, we propose HotelRec, a very large-scale hotel recommendation dataset, based on TripAdvisor, containing 50 million reviews. To the best of our knowledge, HotelRec is the largest publicly available dataset in the hotel domain (50M versus 0.9M) and additionally, the largest recommendation dataset in a single domain and with textual reviews (50M versus 22M).

In this work, we assemble and publish a multilingual Twitter corpus for the task of hate speech detection with inferred four author demographic factors: age, country, gender and race/ethnicity. The corpus covers five languages: English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. We evaluate the inferred demographic labels with a crowdsourcing platform, Figure Eight. To examine factors that can cause biases, we take an empirical analysis of demographic predictability on the English corpus. We measure the performance of four popular document classifiers and evaluate the fairness and bias of the baseline classifiers on the author-level demographic attributes.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Moreover, there is a dearth of annotated corpora for investigating the cross-linguistic variation of adposition semantics, or for building multilingual disambiguation systems. This paper presents a corpus in which all adpositions have been semantically annotated in Mandarin Chinese; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first Chinese corpus to be broadly annotated with adposition semantics. Our approach adapts a framework that defined a general set of supersenses according to ostensibly language-independent semantic criteria, though its development focused primarily on English prepositions (Schneider et al., 2018). We find that the supersense categories are well-suited to Chinese adpositions despite syntactic differences from English. On a Mandarin translation of The Little Prince, we achieve high inter-annotator agreement and analyze semantic correspondences of adposition tokens in bitext.\",\n    language = \"English\",\n    ISBN = \"979-10-95546-34-4\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Then, a translation system generates spoken language translations from the sign language glosses. This paper focuses on the translation system and introduces the STMC-Transformer which improves on the current state-of-the-art by over 5 and 7 BLEU respectively on gloss-to-text and video-to-text translation of the PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset. On the ASLG-PC12 corpus, we report an increase of over 16 BLEU. We also demonstrate the problem in current methods that rely on gloss supervision. The video-to-text translation of our STMC-Transformer outperforms translation of GT glosses. This contradicts previous claims that GT gloss translation acts as an upper bound for SLT performance and reveals that glosses are an inefficient representation of sign language. For future SLT research, we therefore suggest an end-to-end training of the recognition and translation models, or using a different sign language annotation scheme.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

The investigation of said instabilities is concerned with highly non-linear dynamics. Currently, three main methods are used for understanding of such phenomena -- namely analytical and statistical models, experiments, and simulations -- and all of them are primarily investigated and correlated using human expertise. This work demonstrates how a major portion of this research effort could and should be analysed using recent breakthrough advancements in the field of Computer Vision with Deep Learning (CVDL, or Deep Computer-Vision). Specifically, this work targets and evaluates specific state-of-the-art techniques -- such as Image Retrieval, Template Matching, Parameters Regression and Spatiotemporal Prediction -- for the quantitative and qualitative benefits they provide. In order to do so, this research focuses mainly on one of the most representative instabilities, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI). We include an annotated database of images returned from simulations of RTI (RayleAI). Finally, adjusted experimental results and novel physical loss methodologies were used to validate the correspondence of the predicted results to actual physical reality to evaluate the model efficiency. The techniques which were developed and proved in this work can serve as essential tools for physicists in the field of hydrodynamics for investigating a variety of physical systems. Some of them can be easily applied on already existing simulation results, while others could be used via Transfer Learning to other instabilities research. All models as well as the dataset that was created for this work, are publicly available at: https://github.com/scientific-computing-nrcn/SimulAI.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-59851-8\"\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

The corpus contains 370,000 tokens and is larger, more borrowing-dense, OOV-rich, and topic-varied than previous corpora available for this task. Our results show that a BiLSTM-CRF model fed with subword embeddings along with either Transformer-based embeddings pretrained on codeswitched data or a combination of contextualized word embeddings outperforms results obtained by a multilingual BERT-based model.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Recent Transformer-based Language Models have proven capable of producing contextual word representations that reliably convey sense-specific information, simply as a product of self-supervision. Prior work has shown that these contextual representations can be used to accurately represent large sense inventories as sense embeddings, to the extent that a distance-based solution to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks outperforms models trained specifically for the task. Still, there remains much to understand on how to use these Neural Language Models (NLMs) to produce sense embeddings that can better harness each NLM's meaning representation abilities. In this work we introduce a more principled approach to leverage information from all layers of NLMs, informed by a probing analysis on 14 NLM variants. We also emphasize the versatility of these sense embeddings in contrast to task-specific models, applying them on several sense-related tasks, besides WSD, while demonstrating improved performance using our proposed approach over prior work focused on sense embeddings. Finally, we discuss unexpected findings regarding layer and model performance variations, and potential applications for downstream tasks.}\n}\n</codeblock>",

Compared with relying on multiple monolingual models, using a multilingual model has the benefit of a smaller model size, easier in online serving, and generalizability to low-resource languages. However, current multilingual models still underperform individual monolingual models significantly due to model capacity limitations. In this paper, we propose to reduce the gap between monolingual models and the unified multilingual model by distilling the structural knowledge of several monolingual models (teachers) to the unified multilingual model (student). We propose two novel KD methods based on structure-level information: (1) approximately minimizes the distance between the student{'}s and the teachers{'} structure-level probability distributions, (2) aggregates the structure-level knowledge to local distributions and minimizes the distance between two local probability distributions. Our experiments on 4 multilingual tasks with 25 datasets show that our approaches outperform several strong baselines and have stronger zero-shot generalizability than both the baseline model and teacher models.\",\n}\n</codeblock>",

However, keeping track of these annotations to ensure a high-quality multi-purpose data set is a challenging and labour intensive task. We developed the open-source online platform EXACT (EXpert Algorithm Collaboration Tool) that enables the collaborative interdisciplinary analysis of images from different domains online and offline. EXACT supports multi-gigapixel medical whole slide images as well as image series with thousands of images. The software utilises a flexible plugin system that can be adapted to diverse applications such as counting mitotic figures with a screening mode, finding false annotations on a novel validation view, or using the latest deep learning image analysis technologies. This is combined with a version control system which makes it possible to keep track of changes in the data sets and, for example, to link the results of deep learning experiments to specific data set versions. EXACT is freely available and has already been successfully applied to a broad range of annotation tasks, including highly diverse applications like deep learning supported cytology scoring, interdisciplinary multi-centre whole slide image tumour annotation, and highly specialised whale sound spectroscopy clustering.},\nissn={2045-2322},\ndoi={10.1038/s41598-021-83827-4},\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83827-4}\n}\n\n\n</codeblock>",

A common approach to QA has been to fine-tune a pretrained language model on a task-specific labeled dataset. This paradigm, however, relies on scarce, and costly to obtain, large-scale human-labeled data. We propose an unsupervised approach to training QA models with generated pseudo-training data. We show that generating questions for QA training by applying a simple template on a related, retrieved sentence rather than the original context sentence improves downstream QA performance by allowing the model to learn more complex context-question relationships. Training a QA model on this data gives a relative improvement over a previous unsupervised model in F1 score on the SQuAD dataset by about 14{\\%}, and 20{\\%} when the answer is a named entity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQuAD for unsupervised QA.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Such vast amounts of data require formats that allow for efficient storage, transfer, and visualization.

We integrate a state-of-the-art compression technique for vertices, streamlines, and attached scalar and property data. We then compare TRAKO to existing tractography storage methods and provide a detailed evaluation on eight datasets.

In this study, we develop models possessing interpretable inference process for structured prediction. Specifically, we present a method of instance-based learning that learns similarities between spans. At inference time, each span is assigned a class label based on its similar spans in the training set, where it is easy to understand how much each training instance contributes to the predictions. Through empirical analysis on named entity recognition, we demonstrate that our method enables to build models that have high interpretability without sacrificing performance.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We push further in this direction by developing a {``}hard-coded{''} attention variant without any learned parameters. Surprisingly, replacing all learned self-attention heads in the encoder and decoder with fixed, input-agnostic Gaussian distributions minimally impacts BLEU scores across four different language pairs. However, additionally, hard-coding cross attention (which connects the decoder to the encoder) significantly lowers BLEU, suggesting that it is more important than self-attention. Much of this BLEU drop can be recovered by adding just a single learned cross attention head to an otherwise hard-coded Transformer. Taken as a whole, our results offer insight into which components of the Transformer are actually important, which we hope will guide future work into the development of simpler and more efficient attention-based models.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

This LM-based method has the potential to overcome the difficulties existing methods face, such as the propagation of preprocessor errors in count-based methods. In this study, we explore whether the LM-based method is valid for analyzing the word order. As a case study, this study focuses on Japanese due to its complex and flexible word order. To validate the LM-based method, we test (i) parallels between LMs and human word order preference, and (ii) consistency of the results obtained using the LM-based method with previous linguistic studies. Through our experiments, we tentatively conclude that LMs display sufficient word order knowledge for usage as an analysis tool. Finally, using the LM-based method, we demonstrate the relationship between the canonical word order and topicalization, which had yet to be analyzed by large-scale experiments.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

This motivates us to consider \\textit{polyglot} named-entity recognition (NER), where one model is trained using annotated data drawn from more than one language. However, a straightforward implementation of this simple idea does not always work in practice: naive training of NER models using annotated data drawn from multiple languages consistently underperforms models trained on monolingual data alone, despite having access to more training data. The starting point of this paper is a simple solution to this problem, in which polyglot models are \\textit{fine-tuned} on monolingual data to consistently and significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts. To explain this phenomena, we explore the sources of multilingual transfer in polyglot NER models and examine the weight structure of polyglot models compared to their monolingual counterparts. We find that polyglot models efficiently share many parameters across languages and that fine-tuning may utilize a large number of those parameters.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Existing automatic metrics do not capture such mistakes effectively. We tackle the problem of evaluating faithfulness of a generated summary given its source document. We first collected human annotations of faithfulness for outputs from numerous models on two datasets. We find that current models exhibit a trade-off between abstractiveness and faithfulness: outputs with less word overlap with the source document are more likely to be unfaithful. Next, we propose an automatic question answering (QA) based metric for faithfulness, FEQA, which leverages recent advances in reading comprehension. Given question-answer pairs generated from the summary, a QA model extracts answers from the document; non-matched answers indicate unfaithful information in the summary. Among metrics based on word overlap, embedding similarity, and learned language understanding models, our QA-based metric has significantly higher correlation with human faithfulness scores, especially on highly abstractive summaries.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, sentiment knowledge, such as sentiment words and aspect-sentiment pairs, is ignored in the process of pre-training, despite the fact that they are widely used in traditional sentiment analysis approaches. In this paper, we introduce Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training (SKEP) in order to learn a unified sentiment representation for multiple sentiment analysis tasks. With the help of automatically-mined knowledge, SKEP conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives, so as to embed sentiment information at the word, polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. In particular, the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification, aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair. Experiments on three kinds of sentiment tasks show that SKEP significantly outperforms strong pre-training baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on most of the test datasets. We release our code at https://github.com/baidu/Senta.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Commonly comprising hundreds of millions of parameters, these models offer state-of-the-art performance, but at the expense of interpretability. The attention mechanism is the main component of transformer networks. We present AttViz, a method for exploration of self-attention in transformer networks, which can help in explanation and debugging of the trained models by showing associations between text tokens in an input sequence. We show that existing deep learning pipelines can be explored with AttViz, which offers novel visualizations of the attention heads and their aggregations. We implemented the proposed methods in an online toolkit and an offline library. Using examples from news analysis, we demonstrate how AttViz can be used to inspect and potentially better understand what a model has learned.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

It is however quite challenging to formalize, for a variety of reasons. Agda currently (i.e. in 2020) does not have a standard, working formalization of category theory. We document our work on solving this dilemma. The formalization revealed a number of potential design choices, and we present, motivate and explain the ones we picked. In particular, we find that alternative definitions or alternative proofs from those found in standard textbooks can be advantageous, as well as \"fit\" Agda's type theory more smoothly. Some definitions regarded as equivalent in standard textbooks turn out to make different \"universe level\" assumptions, with some being more polymorphic than others. We also pay close attention to engineering issues so that the library integrates well with Agda's own standard library, as well as being compatible with as many of supported type theories in Agda as possible.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs},\n  pages = {327\u2013342},\n  numpages = {16},\n  keywords = {formal mathematics, Agda, category theory},\n  location = {Virtual, Denmark},\n  series = {CPP 2021}\n}\n</codeblock>"

On the other hand, simple recurrent networks (SRNs), which appear more biologically grounded in terms of synaptic connections, have generally been less successful at capturing long-range dependencies as well as the loci of grammatical errors in an unsupervised setting. In this paper, we seek to develop models that bridge the gap between biological plausibility and linguistic competence. We propose a new architecture, the Decay RNN, which incorporates the decaying nature of neuronal activations and models the excitatory and inhibitory connections in a population of neurons. Besides its biological inspiration, our model also shows competitive performance relative to LSTMs on subject-verb agreement, sentence grammaticality, and language modeling tasks. These results provide some pointers towards probing the nature of the inductive biases required for RNN architectures to model linguistic phenomena successfully.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, current research considers de-identification and downstream tasks, such as concept extraction, only in isolation and does not study the effects of de-identification on other tasks. In this paper, we close this gap by reporting concept extraction performance on automatically anonymized data and investigating joint models for de-identification and concept extraction. In particular, we propose a stacked model with restricted access to privacy sensitive information and a multitask model. We set the new state of the art on benchmark datasets in English (96.1{\\%} F1 for de-identification and 88.9{\\%} F1 for concept extraction) and Spanish (91.4{\\%} F1 for concept extraction).\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

They typically contain user descriptions of the problem, the setup, and steps for attempted resolution. Often they also contain various non-natural language text elements like outputs of commands, snippets of code, error messages or stack traces. These elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. However, they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. We formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task, and study the performance of state of the art approaches. We compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline, and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. We also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources, which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. Finally, we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

Hate speech detection has been actively done for languages such as English, German, or Italian, where manually labeled corpus has been released. In this work, we first present 9.4K manually labeled entertainment news comments for identifying Korean toxic speech, collected from a widely used online news platform in Korea. The comments are annotated regarding social bias and hate speech since both aspects are correlated. The inter-annotator agreement Krippendorff{'}s alpha score is 0.492 and 0.496, respectively. We provide benchmarks using CharCNN, BiLSTM, and BERT, where BERT achieves the highest score on all tasks. The models generally display better performance on bias identification, since the hate speech detection is a more subjective issue. Additionally, when BERT is trained with bias label for hate speech detection, the prediction score increases, implying that bias and hate are intertwined. We make our dataset publicly available and open competitions with the corpus and benchmarks.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

In contrast to conventional sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which learn to generate text from scratch as they are trained on parallel corpora, these methods have proven to be much more effective since they are able to learn to make fast and accurate transformations while leveraging powerful pre-trained language models. Inspired by these ideas, we present TST, a simple and efficient Text Simplification system based on sequence Tagging, leveraging pre-trained Transformer-based encoders. Our system makes simplistic data augmentations and tweaks in training and inference on a pre-existing system, which makes it less reliant on large amounts of parallel training data, provides more control over the outputs and enables faster inference speeds. Our best model achieves near state-of-the-art performance on benchmark test datasets for the task. Since it is fully non-autoregressive, it achieves faster inference speeds by over 11 times than the current state-of-the-art text simplification system.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

We estimate it by using Twitter data, and formalize it as a classification problem. Ideology-detection has long been a challenging yet important problem. Certain groups, such as the policy makers, rely on it to make wise decisions. Back in the old days when labor-intensive survey-studies were needed to collect public opinions, analyzing ordinary citizens' political tendencies was uneasy. The rise of social medias, such as Twitter, has enabled us to gather ordinary citizen's data easily. However, the incompleteness of the labels and the features in social network datasets is tricky, not to mention the enormous data size and the heterogeneousity. The data differ dramatically from many commonly-used datasets, thus brings unique challenges. In our work, first we built our own datasets from Twitter. Next, we proposed TIMME, a multi-task multi-relational embedding model, that works efficiently on sparsely-labeled heterogeneous real-world dataset. It could also handle the incompleteness of the input features. Experimental results showed that TIMME is overall better than the state-of-the-art models for ideology detection on Twitter. Our findings include: links can lead to good classification outcomes without text; conservative voice is under-represented on Twitter; follow is the most important relation to predict ideology; retweet and mention enhance a higher chance of like, etc. Last but not least, TIMME could be extended to other datasets and tasks in theory.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery \\&amp; Data Mining},\npages = {2258\u20132268},\nnumpages = {11},\nkeywords = {social network analysis, ideology detection, graph convolutional networks, heterogeneous information network, multi-task learning},\nlocation = {Virtual Event, CA, USA},\nseries = {KDD '20}\n}\n</codeblock>",

As common fairness metrics can be expressed as measures of (conditional) independence between variables, we propose to use the R\u00e9nyi maximum correlation coefficient to generalize fairness measurement to continuous variables. We exploit Witsenhausen\u2019s characterization of the R\u00e9nyi correlation coefficient to propose a differentiable implementation linked to $f$-divergences. This allows us to generalize fairness-aware learning to continuous variables by using a penalty that upper bounds this coefficient. Theses allows fairness to be extented to variables such as mixed ethnic groups or financial status without thresholds effects. This penalty can be estimated on mini-batches allowing to use deep nets. Experiments show favorable comparisons to state of the art on binary variables and prove the ability to protect continuous ones}\n}\n</codeblock>"

An integral part of preprocessing is data transformation into the format required by a given learning algorithm. This paper outlines some of the modern data processing techniques used in relational learning that enable data fusion from different input data types and formats into a single table data representation, focusing on the propositionalization and embedding data transformation approaches. While both approaches aim at transforming data into tabular data format, they use different terminology and task definitions, are perceived to address different goals, and are used in different contexts. This paper contributes a unifying framework that allows for improved understanding of these two data transformation techniques by presenting their unified definitions, and by explaining the similarities and differences between the two approaches as variants of a unified complex data transformation task. In addition to the unifying framework, the novelty of this paper is a unifying methodology combining propositionalization and embeddings, which benefits from the advantages of both in solving complex data transformation and learning tasks. We present two efficient implementations of the unifying methodology: an instance-based PropDRM approach, and a feature-based PropStar approach to data transformation and learning, together with their empirical evaluation on several relational problems. The results show that the new algorithms can outperform existing relational learners and can solve much larger problems.},\nissn={1573-0565},\ndoi={10.1007/s10994-020-05890-8},\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-020-05890-8}\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

While initially inspired by brain anatomy, over the past years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance, yet bringing into question how brain-like they still are. In particular, typical deep models from the machine learning community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as recurrence. Here we demonstrate that better anatomical alignment to the brain and high performance on machine learning as well as neuroscience measures do not have to be in contradiction. We developed CORnet-S, a shallow ANN with four anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, guided by Brain-Score, a new large-scale composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. Despite being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Moreover, our extensive analyses of CORnet-S circuitry variants reveal that recurrence is the main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the CORnet-S \"IT\" neural population resembles the actual monkey IT population dynamics. Taken together, these results establish CORnet-S, a compact, recurrent ANN, as the current best model of the primate ventral visual stream.},\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\narxivId = {1909.06161},\nauthor = {Kubilius, Jonas and Schrimpf, Martin and Hong, Ha and Majaj, Najib J. and Rajalingham, Rishi and Issa, Elias B. and Kar, Kohitij and Bashivan, Pouya and Prescott-Roy, Jonathan and Schmidt, Kailyn and Nayebi, Aran and Bear, Daniel and Yamins, Daniel L.

It is still an open question about what is optimal for this choice and there is a need for theory. The current state-of-the art method is mapping operators manually selected by experts. In this work{,} we demonstrate an automated approach by viewing this problem as supervised learning where we seek to reproduce the mapping operators produced by experts. We present a graph neural network based CG mapping predictor called Deep Supervised Graph Partitioning Model (DSGPM) that treats mapping operators as a graph segmentation problem. DSGPM is trained on a novel dataset{,} Human-annotated Mappings (HAM){,} consisting of 1180 molecules with expert annotated mapping operators. HAM can be used to facilitate further research in this area. Our model uses a novel metric learning objective to produce high-quality atomic features that are used in spectral clustering. The results show that the DSGPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the field of graph segmentation. Finally{,} we find that predicted CG mapping operators indeed result in good CG MD models when used in simulation.\"}\n</codeblock>"

In recent years, various research papers proposed different loss functions used in case of biased data, sparse segmentation, and unbalanced dataset. In this paper, we introduce SemSegLoss, a python package consisting of some of the well-known loss functions widely used for image segmentation. It is developed with the intent to help researchers in the development of novel loss functions and perform an extensive set of experiments on model architectures for various applications. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the presented package have allowed reducing the development time and increased evaluation strategies of machine learning models for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, different applications that use image segmentation can use SemSegLoss because of the generality of its functions. This wide range of applications will lead to the development and growth of AI across all industries.}\n}\n</codeblock>"

It remains a fundamental question on how to evaluate whether a system has the sense-making capability. Existing benchmarks measure common sense knowledge indirectly or without reasoning. In this paper, we release a benchmark to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense. In addition, a system is asked to identify the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense. We evaluate models trained over large-scale language modeling tasks as well as human performance, showing that there are different challenges for system sense-making.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, this approach is still challenged by the large pivot detection problem that should be solved, and by the inherent instability of LSTMs. In this paper we propose a Task Refinement Learning (TRL) approach, in order to solve these problems. Our algorithms iteratively train the PBLM model, gradually increasing the information exposed about each pivot. TRL-PBLM achieves stateof- the-art accuracy in six domain adaptation setups for sentiment classification. Moreover, it is much more stable than plain PBLM across model configurations, making the model much better fitted for practical use.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

        "<codeblock>@inproceedings{dice,\n abstract = {Microcontroller-based embedded devices are at the core of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The security of these devices is of paramount importance. Among the approaches to securing embedded devices, dynamic firmware analysis (e.g., vulnerability detection) gained great attention lately, thanks to its offline nature and low false- positive rates. However, regardless of the analysis and emulation techniques used, existing dynamic firmware analyzers share a major limitation, namely the inability to handle firmware using DMA (Direct Memory Access). It severely limits the types of devices supported and firmware code coverage.\nWe present DICE, a drop-in solution for firmware analyzers to emulate DMA input channels and generate or manipulate DMA inputs (from peripherals to firmware). DICE is designed to be hardware-independent (i.e., no actual peripherals or DMA controllers needed) and compatible with common MCU firmware (i.e., no firmware-specific DMA usages assumed) and embedded architectures. The high-level idea behind DICE is the identi- fication and emulation of the abstract DMA input channels, rather than the highly diverse peripherals and controllers. DICE identifies DMA input channels as the firmware writes the source and destination DMA transfer pointers into the DMA controller. Then DICE manipulates the input transferred through DMA on behalf of the firmware analyzer. DICE does not require firmware source code or additional features from firmware analyzers. We integrated DICE to the recently proposed firmware an- alyzer P2IM (for ARM Cortex-M architecture) and a PIC32 emulator (for MIPS M4K/M-Class architecture). We evaluated it on 83 benchmarks and sample firmware, representing 9 different DMA controllers from 5 different vendors. DICE detected 33 out of 37 DMA input channels, with 0 false positives. It correctly supplied DMA inputs to 21 out of 22 DMA buffers that firmware actually use, which previous firmware analyzers cannot achieve due to the lack of DMA emulation. DICE\u2019s overhead is fairly low, it adds 3.4% on average to P2IM execution time. We also fuzz-tested 7 real-world firmware using DICE and compared the results with the original P2IM. DICE uncovered tremendously more execution paths (as much as 79X) and found 5 unique previously-unknown bugs that are unreachable without DMA emulation.},\n author = {Mera, Alejandro and Feng, Bo and Lu, Long and Kirda, Engin},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy},\n month = {May},\n series = {S&amp;P/Oakland'21},\n title = {DICE: Automatic Emulation of DMA Input Channels for Dynamic Firmware Analysis},\n year = {2021}\n}\n\n</codeblock>"

Data-to-text annotations can be a costly process, especially when dealing with tables which are the major source of structured data and contain nontrivial structures. To this end, we propose a procedure of extracting semantic triples from tables that encodes their structures by exploiting the semantic dependencies among table headers and the table title. Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and spoken dialogue systems by utilizing techniques including tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion, and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing. We present systematic evaluation on DART as well as new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG 2017 to show that DART (1) poses new challenges to existing data-to-text datasets and (2) facilitates out-of-domain generalization.

The audio data is often transformed into two-dimensional spectrogram representations, which are then fed to the neural networks. In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently taking advantage of different spectrogram representations through discriminative processing strategies. There are two main contributions. The first contribution is exploring the impact of the combination of multiple spectrogram representations at different stages, which provides a meaningful reference for the effective spectrogram fusion. The second contribution is that the processing strategies in multiple frequency bands and multiple temporal frames are proposed to make fully use of a single spectrogram representation. The proposed spectrogram processing strategies can be easily transferred to any network structures. The experiments are carried out on the DCASE 2020 Task1 datasets, and the results show that our method could achieve the accuracy of 81.8\\% (official baseline: 54.1\\%) and 92.1\\% (official baseline: 87.3\\%) on the officially provided fold 1 evaluation dataset of Task1A and Task1B, respectively.\"\n}\n</codeblock>",

A downside of numerical weather prediction is that it is lacking the ability for short-term forecasts using the latest available information. By using a data-driven neural network approach we show that it is possible to produce an accurate precipitation nowcast. To this end, we propose SmaAt-UNet, an efficient convolutional neural networks-based on the well known UNet architecture equipped with attention modules and depthwise-separable convolutions. We evaluate our approaches on a real-life datasets using precipitation maps from the region of the Netherlands and binary images of cloud coverage of France. The experimental results show that in terms of prediction performance, the proposed model is comparable to other examined models while only using a quarter of the trainable parameters.}\n}\n</codeblock>"

How can social media platforms more effectively promote reliable information? Existing approaches are difficult to scale and vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we propose using the political diversity of a website\u2019s audience as a quality signal. Using news source reliability ratings from domain experts and web browsing data from a diverse sample of 6,890 US residents, we first show that websites with more extreme and less politically diverse audiences have lower journalistic standards. We then incorporate audience diversity into a standard collaborative filtering framework and show that our improved algorithm increases the trustworthiness of websites suggested to users--especially those who most frequently consume misinformation--while keeping recommendations relevant. These findings suggest that partisan audience diversity is a valuable signal of higher journalistic standards that should be incorporated into algorithmic ranking decisions.},\n  doi      = {10.1038/s41562-021-01276-5},\n  url      = {https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01276-5},\n}\n</codeblock>"

Classical methods (e.g., Poisson reconstruction) start to degrade in the presence of noisy and partial scans. Hence, deep learning based methods have recently been proposed to produce complete surfaces, even from partial scans. However, such data-driven methods struggle to generalize to new shapes with large geometric and topological variations. We present Points2Surf, a novel patch-based learning framework that produces accurate surfaces directly from raw scans without normals. Learning a prior over a combination of detailed local patches and coarse global information improves generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy. Our extensive comparison on both synthetic and real data demonstrates a clear advantage of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on previously unseen classes (on average, Points2Surf brings down reconstruction error by 30{\\%} over SPR and by 270{\\%}+ over deep learning based SotA methods) at the cost of longer computation times and a slight increase in small-scale topological noise in some cases.

The goal of this task is to classify memes based on their emotional content and sentiment. We leverage techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) towards the sentiment classification of internet memes (Subtask A). We consider Bimodal (text and image) as well as Unimodal (text-only) techniques in our study ranging from the Na \u0308{\\i}ve Bayes classifier to Transformer-based approaches. Our results show that a text-only approach, a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with Word2vec embeddings as input, performs superior to all the others. We stand first in the Sentiment analysis task with a relative improvement of 63{\\%} over the baseline macro-F1 score.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for KG entity typing which is trained by jointly utilizing local typing knowledge from existing entity type assertions and global triple knowledge in KGs. Specifically, we present two distinct knowledge-driven effective mechanisms of entity type inference. Accordingly, we build two novel embedding models to realize the mechanisms. Afterward, a joint model via connecting them is used to infer missing entity type instances, which favors inferences that agree with both entity type instances and triple knowledge in KGs. Experimental results on two real-world datasets (Freebase and YAGO) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms and models for improving KG entity typing.

The present work proposes MP3 compression as a means to decrease the impact of Adversarial Noise (AN) in audio samples transcribed by ASR systems. To this end, we generated AAEs with a new variant of the Fast Gradient Sign Method for an end-to-end, hybrid CTC-attention ASR system. The MP3's effectiveness against AN is then validated by two objective indicators: (1) Character Error Rates (CER) that measure the speech decoding performance of four ASR models trained on different audio formats (both uncompressed and MP3-compressed) and (2) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimated for uncompressed and MP3-compressed AAEs that are reconstructed in the time domain by feature inversion. We found that MP3 compression applied to AAEs indeed reduces the CER when compared to uncompressed AAEs. Moreover, feature-inverted (reconstructed) AAEs had significantly higher SNRs after MP3 compression, indicating that AN was reduced. In contrast to AN, MP3 compression applied to utterances augmented with regular noise resulted in more transcription errors, giving further evidence that MP3 encoding is effective in diminishing AN exclusively.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-60276-5\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

We propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Graph Attention Network (KEGAT) architecture for this task, leveraging heterogeneous knowledge from both the structured knowledge base (i.e. ConceptNet) and unstructured text to better improve the ability of a machine in commonsense understanding. This model has a powerful commonsense inference capability via utilizing suitable commonsense incorporation methods and upgraded data augmentation techniques. Besides, an internal sharing mechanism is cooperated to prohibit our model from insufficient and excessive reasoning for commonsense. As a result, this model performs quite well in both validation and explanation. For instance, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in the subtask called Commonsense Explanation (Multi-Choice). We officially name the system as ECNU-SenseMaker. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ECNU-ICA/ECNU-SenseMaker.\",\n}\n</codeblock>"

However, blockchains are closed-world systems which do not have access to external state. To overcome this limitation, oracles have been introduced in various forms and for different purposes. However so far common oracle best practices have not been dissected, classified, and studied in their fundamental aspects. In this paper, we address this gap by studying foundational blockchain oracle patterns in two foundational dimensions characterising the oracles: (i) the data flow direction, i.e., inbound and outbound data flow, from the viewpoint of the blockchain; and (ii) the initiator of the data flow, i.e., whether it is push or pull-based communication. We provide a structured description of the four patterns in detail, and discuss an implementation of these patterns based on use cases. On this basis we conduct a quantitative analysis, which results in the insight that the four different patterns are characterized by distinct performance and costs profiles.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-58779-6\"\n}\n</codeblock>"

We dynamically suggest relevant clinical concepts as a doctor drafts a note by leveraging features from both unstructured and structured medical data. By constraining our architecture to shallow neural networks, we are able to make these suggestions in real time. Furthermore, as our algorithm is used to write a note, we can automatically annotate the documentation with clean labels of clinical concepts drawn from well-structured medical hierarchies to make notes more structured and readable for physicians, patients, and future algorithms. To our knowledge, this system is the only machine learning-based documentation utility for clinical notes deployed in a live hospital setting, and it reduces keystroke burden of clinical concepts by 67% in real environments.},\n author = {Divya Gopinath and Monica Agrawal and Luke Murray and Steven Horng and David Karger and David Sontag},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference},\n title = {Fast, Structured Clinical Documentation via Contextual Autocomplete},\n url_paper = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15153},\n year = {2020}\n}\n</codeblock>"
